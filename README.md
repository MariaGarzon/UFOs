# UFOs Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this project was to extract and compile data of UFO encounters reported in the United States of America to present them on an interactive webpage. 

The webpage includes a table describing each UFO sighting by date, City, State, Country, Shape, Duration, and Comments from the encounter. 

On the webpage the user can input filters on the left side table by the date, city, state, country, or shape of the UFO.

A screenshot of the webpage can be seen below:

## Resources

- Tools: JavaScript, html, and CSS 

## Summary 

- The wbpage is a good start as an overview of UFO sightings, but its functionality is limitted to stagnant data. Future updates should include being able to implement live data functionality without having to manually do it.
